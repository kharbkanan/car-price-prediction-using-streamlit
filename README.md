**#Car Price Prediction Using Streamlit**
🚗 Car Price Prediction Web App using streamlit
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Car Price Prediction System developed using Machine Learning and Streamlit. It allows users to predict the estimated resale price of a car based on its key specifications. 
The goal is to assist both buyers and sellers in making informed, data-driven pricing decisions in the used car market.

🎯 Purpose
To create a user-friendly, real-time prediction system for used car prices.
To apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem.
To demonstrate end-to-end project skills from data preprocessing to model deployment.

🛠️ Technologies and Features
Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
Pandas & NumPy: For data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Scikit-learn: For training the machine learning model.
Random Forest Regressor: For making robust predictions.
Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
Batch File (run_car_app.bat): For launching the app directly with a double-click (no terminal needed).

💡 How It Works
The user launches the application by double-clicking run_car_app.bat.
The Streamlit app opens in the default browser.
The user enters car details like:
Manufacturing year
Engine capacity (cc)
Max power (bhp)
Mileage (kmpl)
Number of seats
Fuel type (Petrol or Diesel)
On clicking “Predict Price”, the trained ML model estimates the resale price instantly.

👁️‍🗨️ Project Highlights
No coding or terminal commands required to use.
Instant predictions with a simple and clean interface.
Real-world data used for model training.
End-to-end solution from data to deployment.
